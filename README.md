#FlashCardApp is a learning tool that helps students/learners summarize their lessons using flashcards. It can also be used as a game that learners can use to remember the lessons they have learned. You can add flashcards per subject. Also, answer questions to randomly selected answers.

FlashCardApp is a collaborative project made by @Demi-werkzam @migueldf10 and @EmnetDegafe after 11 weeks of full-stack web developement bootcamp at Codaissure Code Academy.
